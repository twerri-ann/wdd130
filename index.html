            <p>Hello! My name is Terri-Ann Bassaragh and I'm from Clarendon, Jamaica. I enjoy watching
                anime and kdrama. I'm 17 and the eldest of six siblings. Additionally, I work at my 
                local Probation Office. I'm doing this course as I plan to be an actuary in the future 
                and web knowledge as well as coding is essential in that career. I look forward to the 
                course work and hope to learn a great deal!</p>
