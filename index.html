            <p>Hello! My name is Terri-Ann Bassaragh and I'm from Clarendon, Jamaica. I enjoy watching
                anime and kdrama. I'm 17 and the eldest of six siblings. Additionally, I work at my 
                local Probation Office. I'm doing this course as I plan to be an actuary in the future 
                and web knowledge as well as coding is essential in that career. I look forward to the 
                course work and hope to learn a great deal!</p>

            <p>Clarendon is a parish located on the southern coast of Jamaica. Known for its agricultural landscape, it's often referred to as the "breadbasket" of the island due to its vast production of crops like sugarcane, bananas, and coconuts. The parish is also rich in history and culture, with attractions such as the historical town of May Pen, the capital, and beautiful natural sites like the Milk River Baths, a popular mineral spring resort. Clarendon offers a blend of rural charm and local traditions, making it a unique part of Jamaica’s cultural and economic landscape.</p>
